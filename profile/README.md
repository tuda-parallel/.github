# Parallel Programming @ TU Darmstadt
We are the [Laboratory for Parallel Programming](https://www.parallel.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/) at the Technical University of Darmstadt.
We develop various open-source software packages related to our field of research:
* [**DiscoPoP** (external repository)](https://github.com/discopop-project/discopop) [(website)](https://www.discopop.tu-darmstadt.de/) \
helps software developers parallelize their programs with threads by discovering potential parallelism and making recommendations on how to exploit them. 

* [**ElastiSim** (external repository)](https://github.com/elastisim) [(website)](https://elastisim.github.io) \
is a batch-system simulator supporting the evaluation of scheduling algorithms for malleable workloads.

* [**Extra-P** (external repository)](https://github.com/extra-p/extrap) \
helps developers analyze the scaling behavior of parallel programs by learning performance models automatically from a small set of performance measurements.

* [**FTIO** (local repository)](https://github.com/tuda-parallel/FTIO) \
  captures periodic I/O using frequency techniques.

* [**RELeARN** (local repository)](https://github.com/tuda-parallel/RELeARN) \
is a scalable brain simulator for structural plasticity.

* [**TMIO** (local repository)](https://github.com/tuda-parallel/TMIO) \
  traces synchronous and asynchronous MPI-IO of HPC applications.
